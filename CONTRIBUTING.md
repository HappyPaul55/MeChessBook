## ðŸ›  Development Setup
We recommend using VS Code or a compatible IDE that supports Dev Containers.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/me-chess-book.git
cd me-chess-book
```

### 2. Open in a Dev Container
Make sure you have [Dev Containers extension installed in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).

Open the folder in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

When prompted, reopen in the dev container (or use `F1 â†’ Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`)

### 3. Start the Dev Server
Inside the dev container terminal, run:

```bash
pnpm install # optional as it's ran automatically at container boot up time.
pnpm dev
```
This starts the local development server.

### 4. Run a Production Build (for Testing)
Before [opening a pull request](https://github.com/HappyPaul55/MeChessBook/compare), ensure the app builds correctly:
